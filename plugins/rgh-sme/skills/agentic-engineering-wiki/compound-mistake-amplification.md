title: Compound Mistake Amplification

  Per-step accuracy multiplies across a multi-step agent trajectory, so long
  plans fail even when each individual step looks reliable.

In multi-step [LLM agents](llm-agent.md), errors compound. If each step is 95%
accurate, ten steps yield roughly 60% overall success; a hundred steps fall
near 0.6%. Long tool-using trajectories therefore demand stronger models and
tighter plan validation than single-shot generation.

Concrete edit loops show the same curve: any edit attempt may still succeed
(~90% eventual recovery chance in SWE-agent GPT-4 Turbo runs), but after one
failed edit recovery odds crash (~57%), and unresolved tasks are dominated by
incorrect/over-specific implementations (~52%) plus cascading failed edits
(~23% failed edit recovery). Successful recoveries usually follow ~2 consecutive
failed attempts; unsuccessful ones linger ~4–6 failures before abandoning the
edit. Successful runs finish earlier and cheaper; raising max budget rarely
rescues the long failing tail — design for early localization and
[guardrailed edits](guardrailed-edit-tool.md), not endless retries. Transition
patterns that matter for ACI design: reproduce via `create→edit→python`, then
localize (`find_file`/`search_dir`→`open`→`search_file`→`goto`), then
`edit↔python` loops; cascading `edit`×4 or `scroll_down`×4 is a smell.

This is one reason agents are higher-stakes than non-agentic use cases: tool
access makes each wrong step more damaging, and multi-step runs cost more time
and money. Design responses include shorter plans, stronger planners,
[plan-validate-execute](plan-validate-execute.md) separation,
[reflection and error correction](reflection-and-error-correction.md), and
[human approval gates](human-approval-gates.md) on irreversible actions.
